# Midterm Project - Group I03

🔗 **heroku app:** https://midterm-project-pbp.herokuapp.com/

# 📱 Our application idea
The COVID-19 pandemic affects not only public health, but also the economy, education, and social life of the Indonesian people. Especially younger generations who spent most of their time socializing.

**Mutuals** is an app that will allow the user to connect with lots of different people who share the same interests. 

An inovation that we would like to develop from our app is a **built in chat feature** which will automatically appear once both of them are matched. 
There will also be a **button which will randomly greet someone with the same interest**, this is to help users who lack confidence to reach out first. 

Lastly, since we do not recommend them to physically meet, our application will also provide call feature to ease the communication, however this is for feature implementation due to our lack of skills 👋🏼

# 💡 Modules that we will implement
➡️ log-in or sign-up system

➡️ create the object relational model which records account data 

➡️ Create the user interest form, which can be modified anytime 

➡️ Create the randomizer button

➡️ Create the suggested friends based on the same interest 

➡️ Create the User interface for the website 

➡️ Create the chat feature
